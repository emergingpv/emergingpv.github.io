1. put all py files in one folder (include csv files)
2. To run the files, excute bokeh serve --show and the name of the script or dirctory that contains the demo. For example, bokeh serve --show sliders.py will run the "sliders" demo, and open it up in a new browser tab. 
So if you want to open the 'datafile' demo, put bokeh serve --show datafile.py
csv file contains both certified and non-certified data

`bokeh serve --show datafile.py`
